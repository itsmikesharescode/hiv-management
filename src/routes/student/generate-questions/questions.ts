        description: "Fever is often one of the earliest symptoms of HIV infection. It typically presents as an elevated body temperature above 100.4°F (38°C). This fever is often accompanied by other flu-like symptoms such as chills, night sweats, and generalized malaise, which can make it difficult to distinguish from other viral infections.",

        title: "Fatigue",
        description: "HIV-related fatigue is characterized by persistent and overwhelming tiredness or lack of energy that is not relieved by rest. It can significantly impact daily activities and quality of life. This fatigue may result from the body's immune response to the virus, as well as the virus itself affecting energy levels.",

        title: "Swollen Lymph Nodes",
        description: "Lymph nodes, particularly those in the neck, armpits, and groin, may become enlarged and tender as the body's immune system responds to HIV infection. Swollen lymph nodes are a common early sign of HIV and can persist throughout the course of the infection.",

    {
        title: "Sore Throat",
        description: "HIV can cause a persistent or recurring sore throat, which may be accompanied by difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, or swollen tonsils. This symptom can result from inflammation in the throat due to the body's immune response to the virus.",

    {
        title: "Rash",
        description: "A rash is a common symptom of acute HIV infection, typically appearing as small, red bumps or blotches on the skin. The rash may be itchy and usually occurs on the trunk of the body but can also affect the face, arms, and legs. It typically resolves within a few weeks but can recur during later stages of HIV infection.",

        title: "Muscle Aches and Joint Pain",

        title: "Nausea, Vomiting, and Diarrhea",
        description: "Digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can occur in individuals with HIV, particularly during the acute phase of infection. These symptoms may result from direct effects of the virus on the gastrointestinal tract or secondary infections and medications used to treat HIV.",

        title: "Weight Loss",
        description: "Unexplained weight loss is a common symptom of HIV infection, particularly in advanced stages of the disease. This weight loss may result from a combination of factors, including decreased appetite, malabsorption of nutrients, and increased metabolism due to inflammation and immune activation.",

        title: "Night Sweats",
        description: "Night sweats refer to excessive sweating during sleep that is not related to room temperature or excessive bedding. Night sweats are a common symptom of HIV infection and may occur intermittently or persistently. They can disrupt sleep and contribute to fatigue and overall discomfort.",

        title: "Yeast Infections",
        description: "HIV can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to fungal infections such as oral thrush (white patches inside the mouth) and genital candidiasis (vaginal or penile yeast infection). These infections can cause discomfort, itching, and discharge.",

        title: "Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)",
        description: "In women, HIV infection can increase the risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a bacterial infection of the female reproductive organs. PID can cause symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, and painful intercourse.",

        title: "Opportunistic Infections",
        description: "HIV weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, candidiasis, and certain cancers (e.g., Kaposi's sarcoma). These infections can occur at any stage of HIV infection but are more common in individuals with advanced disease or untreated HIV.",
